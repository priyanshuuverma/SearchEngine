## 1.   A superpower or the ability to turn ideas into code and this very powerfull that helped me build my own search engine is MAVEN.

1. Maven made it easy to manage and integrate third-party libraries like the MySQL JDBC driver, JSoup and servlet APIs through the pom.xml, eliminating manual JAR handling.

2. It enforced a standard directory layout (src/main/java, src/main/webapp, etc.) and automated compilation, packaging, and deployment using built-in commands like mvn clean install.

3. Maven simplified building web projects with JSP by managing servlet containers and dependencies like javax.servlet, which are essential for Java web apps.

4. Using Maven in IntelliJ IDEA ensured consistent builds across environments, improved code completion, and reduced setup time when switching systems or sharing code.



## Used Jsoup , JAVA , OOps, DFS DLS , HashMap.
